# Development Log

**5/11/2023** (v.0.1)
- Name changed to "A Fistful of Stardust".

**5/8/2023** (v.0.1)
- Working title: "Stardust Shuffle".
- The primary goal at the moment is to sort out what elements of the Cairn documument need to be altered in order to properly represent the feel of the setting. 
- The initial rules will focus on what is necessary in order to facilitate play for what I consider to be the first "chunk" of the game, centering around the first job and formulating a plan to find a ship and get off world.
